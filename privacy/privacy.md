### 4. Data security

We make every effort to ensure the security of your data within the framework of the applicable data protection laws and technical possibilities.

Your personal data will be transmitted encrypted. We use the SSL (Secure Socket Layer) coding system, but point out that data transmission over the Internet (e.g. when communicating by e-mail) can have security gaps. A complete protection of the data against access by third parties is not possible. To secure your data, we maintain technical and organizational security measures in accordance with Art. 32 GDPR, which we continually adapt to the state of the art. Furthermore, we do not guarantee that our services will be available at certain times; malfunctions, interruptions or failures cannot be ruled out.

# 5. Storage period

Unless specifically stated, we will only store personal data for as long as is necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected.

In some cases, the law provides for the retention of personal data, for example in tax or company law. In these cases, the data is only stored by us for these legal purposes, but is not processed elsewhere and deleted after the legal retention period has expired.

### 6. Cookies

Our website uses so-called cookies. These are small text files which are stored on your end device with the aid of the browser. They do not cause any damage.

We use cookies to make our services more user-friendly. Some cookies remain stored on your end device until you delete them. They allow us to recognize your browser again on your next visit.

You can prevent cookies from being stored by using the appropriate settings in your browser software. Deactivating cookies may limit the functionality of our website.

### 7. Web analysis

Our website uses functions provided by the web analysis provider Google Analytics. This service is provided by Google Inc. (1600 Amphitheater Parkway Mountain View, CA 94043, USA) and uses cookies to enable the analysis of the use of our website by your users. The information generated in this way is transferred to the provider’s server and stored there.

You can prevent this from happening by changing the settings on your browser so that cookies are not stored.

All appropriate measures are taken to ensure that this service can be used in compliance with data protection policy.

Our interest, in the sense of the GDPR (legitimate interest), lies in improving our services and Internet presence. As the privacy of our users is very important to us, the user data are anonymised.

The relationship to the web analysis provider is based on an Adequacy Decision granted by the European Commission (“Privacy Shield”), which guarantees an adequate data protection level for data transfers to certified companies in the USA.

The data shall be processed on the basis of the statutory provisions of Sect. 96 Para 3 of the Telecommunications Act and Article 6(1)f (legitimate interest) of the GDPR.

### 8. Google Analytics Remarketing

Our websites use the features of Google Analytics Remarketing combined with the cross-device capabilities of Google AdWords and DoubleClick. This service is provided by Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheater Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA.

This feature makes it possible to link target audiences for promotional marketing created with Google Analytics Remarketing to the cross-device capabilities of Google AdWords and Google DoubleClick. This allows advertising to be displayed based on your personal interests, identified based on your previous usage and surfing behavior on one device (e.g. your mobile phone), on other devices (such as a tablet or computer).

Once you have given your consent, Google will associate your web and app browsing history with your Google Account for this purpose. That way, any device that signs in to your Google Account can use the same personalized promotional messaging.

To support this feature, Google Analytics collects Google-authenticated IDs of users that are temporarily linked to our Google Analytics data to define and create audiences for cross-device ad promotion.

You can permanently opt out of cross-device remarketing/targeting by turning off personalized advertising in your Google Account; follow this link: https://www.google.com/settings/ads/onweb/.

The aggregation of the data collected in your Google Account data is based solely on your consent, which you may give or withdraw from Google per Art. 6 (1) (a) DSGVO. For data collection operations not merged into your Google Account (for example, because you do not have a Google Account or have objected to the merge), the collection of data is based on Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR. The website operator has a legitimate interest in analyzing anonymous user behavior for promotional purposes.

Google AdWords and Google Conversion Tracking
This website uses Google AdWords. AdWords is an online advertising program from Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheater Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, United States (“Google”).

As part of Google AdWords, we use so-called conversion tracking. When you click on an ad served by Google, a conversion tracking cookie is set. Cookies are small text files that your internet browser stores on your computer. These cookies expire after 30 days and are not used for personal identification of the user. Should the user visit certain pages of the website and the cookie has not yet expired, Google and the website can tell that the user clicked on the ad and proceeded to that page.

Each Google AdWords advertiser has a different cookie. Thus, cookies cannot be tracked using the website of an AdWords advertiser. The information obtained using the conversion cookie is used to create conversion statistics for the AdWords advertisers who have opted for conversion tracking. Customers are told the total number of users who clicked on their ad and were redirected to a conversion tracking tag page. However, advertisers do not obtain any information that can be used to personally identify users. If you do not want to participate in tracking, you can opt-out of this by easily disabling the Google Conversion Tracking cookie by changing your browser settings. In doing so, you will not be included in the conversion tracking statistics.

Conversion cookies are stored based on Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR. The website operator has a legitimate interest in analyzing user behavior to optimize both its website and its advertising.

For more information about Google AdWords and Google Conversion Tracking, see the Google Privacy Policy: https://www.google.de/policies/privacy/.

You can configure your browser to inform you about the use of cookies so that you can decide on a case-by-case basis whether to accept or reject a cookie. Alternatively, your browser can be configured to automatically accept cookies under certain conditions or to always reject them, or to automatically delete cookies when closing your browser. Disabling cookies may limit the functionality of this website.
