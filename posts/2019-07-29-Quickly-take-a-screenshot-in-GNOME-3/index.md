Here is a list of shortcuts to create a screenshot in GNOME 3:
- <kbd>Prt Sc</kbd>: whole desktop (all monitors)
- <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>Prt Sc</kbd>: current window
- <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Prt Sc</kbd>: selected area

Pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> as well, will copy the screenshot to the clipboard instead of saving it as a file.

Check [the official documentation](https://help.gnome.org/users/gnome-help/stable/screen-shot-record.html) for more information.
