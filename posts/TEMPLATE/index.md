The other day a friend of mine recommended me a great website: [BugMeNot](http://bugmenot.com)

Essentially, it's a website to share login credentials for websites / web-services.

If you stumble upon a website forcing you to log in to continue (reading / downloading / ...), it's worth a check for credentials at BugMeNot.
