Here is a list of shortcuts on how to create a screenshot in GNOME 3:

- <kbd>Prt Sc</kbd>: whole desktop (all monitors)
- <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>Prt Sc</kbd>: current window
- <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Prt Sc</kbd>: selected area

By pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> simultaneously, the screenshot will be copied into the clipboard instead of being saved as a file.

Check the [official documentation](https://help.gnome.org/users/gnome-help/stable/screen-shot-record.html) for more information.
